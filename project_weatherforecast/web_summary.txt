Section 33:
1. html basics: learnt about paragraph, heading, a href link, img link, navigation.

2. learnt about flask, created a templates folder to store my html websites like demo, about.
imported flask and render template to find the templates folder, made links /home and /about to navigate to them
Figured out a way to display an image in the lask framework

removed about and demo files from the templates folder since they were just a demo
added home.html file into the template, home.html is the place where i'll store my weather forecast api

modified main.py to access temperature for a given station and date.
