The Task Scheduler project is a comprehensive to-do list application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The project includes three different implementations: a Command Line Interface (CLI), a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using FreeSimpleGUI, and a web application using Streamlit. Each implementation provides a unique way to interact with the to-do list, catering to different user preferences.
