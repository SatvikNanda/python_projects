Understanding the gui frontend code:

The code uses 2 libraries- The functions to use get_todo and write_todo, and freeSimpleGUI for the user interface

There is a label variable to write the heading
There are 4 buttons, Add,Edit,Complete,Exit

There is an input_box for writing the todo, the KEY IS TODO
There is a list_box for showing the todos, the KEY IS TODOS 


There is a window variable to display all the above information in a sequential manner

case:Add
a new variable is created to retrieve the existing list
a new variable is made to store the new todo
the new todo is added in the list and updated
The window which contains the list is updated

case:Edit
a new variable is made to get the todo to edit, ['todos'][0] this ensures that not the whole list but only the selected element
the new todo is taken from the input box 
the index of the todo to edit is found and updated
The window which contains the list is updated

case:Complete
the todo to Complete is selected from the list
the list is called in a variable called todos 
todo to complete is removed from the todo

windows is updated to get the new list and to remove the item from input box as well

case:todos
occurs when a person clicks on any of the current todos, this copies the todo in the input box
